A lightweight and easy-to-use tool to help you with your GDPR compliance tasks.


== Description ==

Features include a cookie and tracking-script consent popup, integrations for WooCommerce and Contact Form 7. It logs when users first accept your privacy policy and can also inject your Google Analytics tracking code for you.

Installing this plugin is no guarantee that your site will magically become fully GDPR compliant, but it should make it much easier for you to get there.


== Features ==

* Automatically add Privacy consent check boxes to your ContactForm7 forms, with the consent coming through into the contact emails.
* Detect and log Terms & Conditions consent in WooCommerce.
* Detect tracking JS scripts and, in some cases, defer them running until the user consents.
* Inject Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel and Microsoft Clarity trackers directly from Mini WP GDPR.
* Works with the official WooCommerce Google Analytics Integration plugin.
* See which WP users have given their consent in the main WP users admin table.
